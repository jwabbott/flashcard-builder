# Flashcard-Builder Readme

**By Joshua W. Abbott**

# Introduction

Hi, my name is Josh Abbott, and I wrote this script to create flashcards for learning the names and faces of new students. Working in higher education, I meet hundreds of new students every year and struggle with remembering their names. The best method I have found for memorizing any kind of information is to use flashcards. However, making flashcards with names, photos, and other information can be very time-intensive and tedious. That is why came up with this project. It lets me upload a spreadsheet with student names and other basic info, along with a folder of the students' headshot images, and it builds the flashcards for me. All I have to do is print out the sheets and cut out the cards. And I'm ready to start learning those names and faces.

I am also using this as my project for CAS-502: CAS Computation in the School for Complex Adaptives Systems at Arizona State University.

NOTE: The sample student information contained here is fictional and does not disclose any actual student information, which is protected under FERPA. The headshot images were ai-generated from the website, [thispersondoesnotexist.org](https://thispersonnotexist.org/).

# Overview

## Inputs

This script requires two inputs: a CSV file with student data, and a folder containing the students' headshot images. 

The CSV file should contain the following columns, with one student for each row:
- name
- hometown
- undergrad_school
- major
- image_filename

The image files in the headshots folder should follow this naming convention: "image001.jpeg", "image002.jpeg", etc.  

## Output

With the inputs above, the script will create a two-sided MS Word document containing flashcards for 10 students per page. The front contains the student name and information, and the back holds the students' photos. You can print the document, being sure to set the printer settings to front-and-back, and then cut out the cards.
