The purpose of this script is to create flashcards for memorizing people's names and faces.

It uses names and other information about individuals from text files, along with image files with those individuals' respective head shots.
It then generates two-sided documents that have the name and other information on one side, matched with the headshot image on the other side. 
The sheets can be printed and cut out to be used as flashcards.
